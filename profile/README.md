# OpenModels - An Open Source Community Initiative



## 1. Introduction



   **OpenModels** is a community-driven, open-source initiative aimed at making the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as ubiquitous as water and electricity during the second Industrial Revolution, and traffic and data during the third Industrial Revolution. Our mission is to ensure that everyone has equal access to the value dividends of the fourth Industrial Revolution. We are committed to promoting a culture of sharing, collaboration, creation, and delivery, fostering an inclusive environment where people from all walks of life can benefit from AI technology.



## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of OpenModels are to:

- Develop and maintain a comprehensive repository of open-source AI models and tools that cater to a wide range of applications and industries.

- Facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration among researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds.

- Provide educational resources, training materials, and workshops to help individuals and organizations leverage the potential of AI technologies.

- Advocate for ethical and responsible AI development and deployment practices, ensuring that AI technologies are used for the betterment of society.

- Engage with policymakers, industry leaders, and other stakeholders to promote the adoption of open-source AI models and foster an ecosystem of innovation.

  

## 3. Proposed Activities



To achieve our objectives, OpenModels will undertake the following activities:

- Establish an online platform for sharing and collaborating on AI models, tools, and resources.

- Organize regular hackathons, workshops, webinars, and meetups to foster a sense of community and collaboration among members.

- Develop and maintain comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and use-case examples to help individuals and organizations adopt and implement AI technologies.

- Engage in outreach programs to increase awareness about OpenModels and encourage participation from diverse groups, including underrepresented communities and individuals.

- Collaborate with academic institutions, research organizations, and industry partners to drive innovation in AI and expand the scope of OpenModels' offerings.

  

## 4. Governance and Organization Structure

OpenModels will be governed by a core team of volunteers, including researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts, who will oversee the strategic direction and day-to-day operations of the initiative. In addition, we will establish several working groups focused on specific areas of interest, such as AI in healthcare, education, finance, and transportation. These working groups will be responsible for driving innovation and collaboration within their respective domains.



## 5. Funding and Support



To ensure the sustainability and success of OpenModels, we will actively seek funding and support from various sources, including grants, sponsorships, donations, and partnerships. We will also explore revenue-generating opportunities, such as offering premium services, consulting, and training, to help sustain the initiative and support its growth.



## 6. Conclusion



OpenModels is an ambitious initiative that aims to democratize access to AI technologies and ensure that everyone can share in the value dividends of the fourth Industrial Revolution. By fostering a culture of sharing, collaboration, creation, and delivery, we believe that OpenModels has the potential to drive significant social and economic impact, ultimately improving the lives of millions of people around the world.
